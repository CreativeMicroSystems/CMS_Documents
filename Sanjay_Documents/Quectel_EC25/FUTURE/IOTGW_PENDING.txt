----- ISSUES -----
1. In AP+AP mode, only the AP configured first can be pinged from the Wi-Fi client. The AP configured second can establish a connection, and the Wi-Fi client can connect to it, but its IP address cannot be pinged.
2. Uploading configuration files from the webpage is sending junk data along with the config file. As a result, while untarring the config file, it shows a checksum error.
3. Uploading TLS certificates from the webpage is sending junk data along with the certificate files.

------ PENDING DEVELOPMENT/TESTING -------
1. Testing the Alibaba server connection.
2. Testing the storing and resending of failed MQTT transmitted messages.
3. Creating a utility to set the serial number.
4. Adding formula conversion, value-to-string mapping, and bit-to-string mapping to the webpage.
5. Implementing a mechanism to handle .log files to enforce a maximum size limit and store them on the SD card.
6. After adding formula conversion, value-to-string mapping, and bit-to-string mapping to the webpage, these features must also be included in the generate_config file.
7. Adding the last restart time and the last restart reason to the webpage.
